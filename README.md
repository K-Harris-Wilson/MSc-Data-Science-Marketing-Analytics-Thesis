# MSc-Data-Science-Marketing-Analytics-Thesis

My MSc thesis in Data Science Marketing Analytics revolves around forecasting spare part demand. To achieve this, I have compiled a repository of data from two sources available on GitHub. The first source, maintained by Daniel de Haan, offers data related to SPDF and benchmarks various intermittent demand forecasting methods on both industrial and simulated datasets. The second source, maintained by Connor Herring, focuses specifically on Spare Part Demand Forecasting.

To create a comprehensive dataset for my forecasting analysis, I have merged and modified the data from these two sources. The analysis is conducted in Python and includes Jupyter Notebooks, as well as an HTML variant that can be easily accessed through web browsers to view the output.
