# MSc-Data-Science-Marketing-Analytics-Thesis

My repository is a collection of data that I've compiled from two sources that I found on GitHub. The first source is maintained by Daniel de Haan, and it contains data related to SPDF. The SPDF repository is focused on benchmarking several intermittent demand forecasting methods on both industrial and simulated datasets related to spare part demand forecasting. The second source is maintained by Connor Herring and focuses on Spare Part Demand Forecasting.

By combining these two sources of data, I've slightly modified both sets to accomodate my forecasting.
